# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
##puts "cleaning database"
#Boat.destroy_all
#puts "creating database"#

#  boat = Boat.create(
#    name: Faker::TvShows::Friends.character,
#    address: Faker::Address.street_address,
#    price: rand(100..1500),
#    description: Faker::Lorem.paragraph(sentence_count: 2, supplemental: true)
